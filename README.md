# Research-Flowcharts-Pseudocode Antonio Ruiz Nolasco and Isai Massa Mandujano

# Fundamental concepts:
### Algorithim: 
Is a **series of steps** that you have to follow in order to comple a task.
### Characteristics:

- It have to be clear

- It should have a well define input and output

- They shuould have a definte number of steps

# Algorithm representation:

### Differentiate control structures in the design and construction of an algorithm:

- __Nested structures__: default mode. Sequential execution of code statements (one line after another) -- like following a recipe

- __Selective structures__: used for decisions, branching -- choosing between 2 or more alternative paths. In C++, these are the types of selection statements:

if
if/else
switch

- **Repetitive structures** used for looping, i.e. repeating a piece of code multiple times in a row. In C++, there are three types of loops:

while
do/while
for

### Describe the types of algorithm representation:
- Pseudo code is a high-level design of a program or algorithm. Sequence and selection are two constructs used in pseudo code.

- Flowchart: A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.

# Data types and expressions: 
### Define the characteristics of the variables and constants

### Types of computational data:
- Numeric: It refers to all the dta represented with numbers.
- Logic: It means all the data described as much as possible
- String and characters: It is used to 
- Arrangements:

### Representation of computational data:
- Variables

- Constants

### Types of computational operations:
Operators:
- Arithmetic
- Logic
- Relationships
Operands:
-Variables
-Constants
Expressions:
- Arithmetic
- Logic
